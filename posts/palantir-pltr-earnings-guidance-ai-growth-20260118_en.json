With its Q4 2025 earnings release scheduled for February 2, 2026, the market anticipates strong revenue expansion and profitability improvement this year. However, its high valuation and short-term volatility warrant caution."

        "content": "Palantir shares have posted impressive gains—up 340% in 2024 and 135% in 2025—driven by AI growth momentum. After peaking at $207 in November 2025, the stock recently pulled back around 5–9% to the $168 range. Despite strong earnings expectations, valuation remains demanding, with a trailing P/E near 399x and a forward P/E estimated around 170–245x, implying continued volatility."

        "content": "For 2026, revenue is projected to grow by approximately 70–80% year-over-year, led by a 51–70% increase in government contract revenues. These growth drivers could help offset valuation pressure, but the combination of 4–5% monthly pullbacks and elevated multiples remains a source of risk. No major litigation, M&A activity, or regulatory issues have been reported within the past 30 days."

Citi raised its price target to $235, citing AI business expansion and robust remaining deal value (RDV) as core revenue growth drivers.
