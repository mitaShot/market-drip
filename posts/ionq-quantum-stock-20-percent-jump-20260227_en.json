Q4 revenue hit $61.9M, up 429% from last year, and annual revenue crossed $130M for the first time. The numbers alone scream 'business is really taking off.'\nAnd management guided 2026 revenue at $225M-$245M, well above market expectations. In short, it's signaling a shift from 'research lab vibe' to 'real company taking customer money,' which pulled in story-chasing money all at once.",

Today's 10%+ single-day jump revived that volatility big time.\nCompared to broader market, even more interesting. Nasdaq was weak same day but IONQ charged up solo - not dragged by index, pure company-news driven rally. But when something rips like that independent of market, pullbacks almost always follow. So this zone feels like 'could go higher if greedy, but correction wouldn't surprise either.'",
