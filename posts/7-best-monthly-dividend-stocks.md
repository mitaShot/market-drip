Monthly dividend stocks are a favorite among income investors. Unlike most companies that pay quarterly, these stocks provide a paycheck 12 times a year.

## Why Choose Monthly Dividends?

The primary benefit is **faster compounding**. If you reinvest your dividends, doing so monthly instead of quarterly can slightly boost your long-term returns. Additionally, for retirees living off dividends, monthly payments align better with regular bills.

## Top Picks for 2025

### 1. Realty Income (O)

Known as "The Monthly Dividend Company," Realty Income is a REIT that has paid consistent dividends for over 50 years. It focuses on retail properties with high occupancy rates.

### 2. Main Street Capital (MAIN)

This BDC (Business Development Company) provides capital to private companies. It not only pays a monthly yield but arguably offers special dividends when profits are high.

## Risks to Consider

Just because a stock pays monthly doesn't mean it's safe. Always check the payout ratio and the company's earnings stability before investing.
