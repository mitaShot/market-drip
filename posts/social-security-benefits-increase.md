The Social Security Administration announced a significant Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) for 2026.

## What is the Increase?

Beneficiaries will see a 3.2% increase in their checks starting in January.

## Medicare Premiums

Part B premiums are also rising, which may offset some of the gains for many retirees.
