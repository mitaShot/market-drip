The company reported Q4 results that crushed consensus estimates for both revenue and EPS, marking a decisive 'earnings surprise'. After enduring a ~12% pullback amid valuation concerns, this beat flipped investor sentiment from cautious to aggressively bullish."

The stock had corrected ~12% over the prior month amid broader software sector valuation pressure, but this report catalyzed a sharp V-shaped reversal. Surging volume confirms broad institutional and retail interest."

Palantir guided US Commercial revenue growth at **115%** for 2026 - more than double Wall Street's 65% consensus. This validates AI Platform (AIP) monetization at scale. Trump administration tailwinds accelerate defense and public sector contracts. The key risk remains elevated valuation: current P/E ~340x leaves little margin for execution hiccups."
