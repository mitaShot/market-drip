This morning they announced that 'Sonelokimab (SLK),' a drug in development, showed very good results in spinal arthritis phase 2 trials. Last fall it slid in a clinical trial for a different disease (hidradenitis suppurativa) and the stock nearly halved, right? So people thought, 'Ah, they’re done,' but this data proved 'they’re not dead yet!' Plus, today was exactly Investor Day, so the management came out to talk about future plans, which sharply boosted expectations.",

Technically it’s significant because it digested all the 'toxic selling pressure' accumulated so far at once. However, it surged too fast today, causing a bit of a stretched gap. It’d be great if it zipped straight to $25 or $30, but usually after such news, short-term traders take profits and the stock often pulls back with a tail. It’s mentally healthier to check if the $18 level holds before entering.",

Bio stocks often hurt shareholders with dilutive fundraises when money runs out, but this one has a low chance of that. But risks are clear too. This is a phase 2 success, but the real game is phase 3. Also, competitors already firmly hold the market, so just 'good efficacy' won’t cut it — they must continue proving it’s 'overwhelmingly good.'
