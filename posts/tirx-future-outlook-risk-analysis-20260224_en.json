But this year it suddenly became a totally different company. News broke about final negotiations to merge with a top Asia-Pacific InsurTech firm, and simultaneously a plan to buy 15,000 Bitcoins was announced. This is a typical 'business model overhaul' strategy often used when Nasdaq small caps attract attention, but this time the scale is quite exceptional. They said they would acquire Bitcoin through a stock swap. The market heated up immediately and volatility remains high.",
