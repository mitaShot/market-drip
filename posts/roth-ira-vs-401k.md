Deciding between a Roth IRA and a 401(k) comes down to your current tax bracket versus your expected future tax bracket.

## The Match Comes First

Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get your employer match. That's free money.

## Tax Now or Tax Later?

If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, pay taxes now with a Roth. If lower, take the deduction now with a traditional 401(k).
