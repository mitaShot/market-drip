Now, dip-buyers are stepping back in as investors reassess its role as a mission-critical AI platform provider for governments and enterprises . The stock is attracting traders who believe the de-rating went too far relative to its growth runway and sticky contracts."

The current bounce, accompanied by elevated volume, suggests more than a random dead-cat rally as the stock attempts to build a new base above recent lows. Traders are watching whether price can hold higher lows and reclaim key moving averages to confirm a durable trend reversal."

Strategic partnerships and expanding use cases strengthen the narrative that Palantir is evolving into core infrastructure rather than a discretionary tool. Risks include its premium valuation versus traditional software peers, political and regulatory scrutiny around government work, and the possibility that growth expectations remain too optimistic if IT spending tightens."
