NVDA is currently the full face of ‘AI infrastructure.’ Recently, the data center business has grown to account for most of total sales, and news that last quarter’s revenue hit a record level keeps circulating, so the market clings to this stock as a leading growth name.\nOn top of this, Big Tech announced spending hundreds of billions of dollars on AI infrastructure this year, so there is an expectation that a significant part of that money will flow to AI accelerator suppliers like NVIDIA. Wow... seeing such numbers, investors can’t help but feel like ‘If you miss this game, you’re losing out.’\nOn the policy side, the U.S. government officially formalized several projects and partnerships to promote AI infrastructure as a national strategy, creating a narrative that “the government is backing server rooms.” Therefore, today’s move reflects more than just a one-day news reaction; it feels more natural to see it as a ‘theme reconfirmation’ combining earnings → Big Tech AI investment plans → policy support.",

So, just looking at today’s momentum, it seems like it’s just rising again, but in the big picture, it’s already a pretty ‘expensive zone.’\nLooking at the last few days, even when the overall market wavered, NVDA dipped but was quickly pulled back up repeatedly, and intense buying and selling battles near the $180 level appeared often. Amazing, right? Compared to indices and even within the AI semiconductor sector, its relative strength is quite high, meaning people regard this stock as the primary ‘AI horse.’\nBut honestly, at this stage, volatility tends to intensify. Because it’s already risen a lot, even slightly disappointing news leads to long upper shadows and downward pressure, and conversely good news squeezes short positions causing additional spikes, so it’s safer to keep in mind that volatility is larger than directional movement.",

        "content": "Now let’s look at the real core catalysts and risks together. The biggest catalyst the market sees recently is the ‘explosion of data center and AI server investments.’ The data center portion of NVDA’s sales has already become overwhelmingly large, and it’s repeatedly emphasized that data center revenue grew by the high double digits year-on-year in the latest quarter. This means it is fully positioned not as a gaming graphics card company but as an ‘AI factory equipment company.’\nMoreover, large cloud companies have announced plans to steadily increase AI infrastructure investments over the next few years, creating a market atmosphere that receives this almost as a long-term story. Oh, and importantly! Unless these long-term investment plans collapse suddenly, many believe NVDA has secured a fairly thick shield on the demand side.\nOn the contrary, there are two risks. First, with a market cap already in the trillions, even small disappointments can cause a big correction owing to ‘failure to meet expectations.’ Second, holding roughly 80%+ of GPU market share in a dominant position makes the stock more sensitive to competition, regulation, and policy variables such as export restrictions involving specific countries. So this stock tends to rise well on good news but can get hit harder than others on bad news.",

NVDA recently announced quarterly revenue around $57 billion, with data center revenue in the lower $50 billion range hitting an all-time high; the 60%+ growth rate was repeatedly mentioned in articles. Wow... just looking at the numbers, it’s monstrous.\nHowever, on Wall Street, there’s also chatter that 'it’s hard to do better than this.' Around earnings announcements, there was a clash between ‘Will they beat expectations again?’ and ‘Are we near peak?’ resulting in the stock price swinging intensely with every piece of news.\nAdditionally, Big Tech’s forecast of spending $650 billion on AI infrastructure in 2026 contributed to the market loving the narrative that NVDA sits at the center of this money flow. With earnings, AI investment plans, and government projects (like AI infrastructure cooperation with DOE) all tied together, just a few headlines make it easy to grasp the ‘oh, that’s why it’s going up again’ picture.",

Amazing, right? In such a structure, a break to the upside can go much further than expected, but a drop can trigger a burst of calls intensifying the correction.\nNo particularly large insider buys or sells have been reported recently, and management has not been offloading big blocks for now.

According to many analyses, NVDA holds a mid-80% range share of the AI data center GPU market, with AMD and Intel splitting the remainder, clearly making NVDA the ‘number one’ tier. Thus, the premium the market applies is somewhat understandable.\nHowever, competition in AI accelerators is getting more intense. AMD is aggressively expanding its AI GPU lineup, and Big Tech firms increasingly develop their own chips, signaling efforts to reduce dependence on NVDA. Nevertheless, thanks to the solid CUDA ecosystem and existing software/developer community, the consensus is that a dramatic shift in the landscape is unlikely in the short term.\nIn summary, NVDA trades at a notably higher valuation than peers, but given its market share, ecosystem, and technology, it holds the role of the representative stock that investors buy ‘knowing it’s expensive but having no choice.’ The investor dilemma ultimately comes down to one question: 'Will this premium rise further, or will it be the first to be cut at the slightest slip?'

However, AI infrastructure players like NVDA are cases where actual cash flow and earnings back them up, making the ‘AI investment cycle’ a much bigger variable than ‘interest expenses.’\nRegarding exchange rates and raw materials, although semiconductor supply chains and server component price changes may impact margins, considering the company’s scale and pricing power, it is largely believed NVDA can absorb most of these effects. So even if macro conditions worsen, the fundamental story likely won’t shake until AI data center investments completely halt.\nFurthermore, the U.S. government and DOE’s move to build AI supercomputers and research infrastructure means policy is at least neutral and likely friendly over the long term. Thus, it’s a realistic interpretation that NVDA currently holds a position as a candidate to recover first, despite macro headwinds, thanks to policy and industry structure.",

        "bull_case": "The positive scenario is simple. If Big Tech’s AI infrastructure investments they announced are actually executed, and demand from government and research institutions including major DOE projects adds on, NVDA can continue growing data center revenue and maintain its position as the leading AI infrastructure stock with both growth and profitability. This scenario could justify the current high valuation, with buying continuing on every pullback.",
        "bear_case": "The negative scenario is the opposite: expectations got too far ahead. If AI infrastructure investment slows faster than expected or Big Tech quickly increases their own chip share, the market could face ‘growth peak-out’ fears first. If this combines with regulatory or export control risks, even small earnings missteps could trigger sharp valuation cuts and price drops.",
        "strategy": "Now for the realistic strategy. Frankly, NVDA isn’t ‘super cheap’ right now, but it’s not a ‘must not buy at all costs’ level either. Having risen multiple times since early 2024, it’s better to dollar-cost average slowly for those who believe the AI investment cycle will last longer rather than go all-in at once.\nTo sum up in one line? It’s closer to a stage where ‘only those who believe in the long AI infrastructure battle slowly accumulate on pullbacks.’ Around short-term events (earnings, Big Tech conferences, policy announcements), excessive swings may happen, so it’s recommended to only allocate a position that won’t shake your account during quick drops.\nIf you’re a complete beginner, indirect exposure through AI or semiconductor ETFs with large NVDA weightings can be a good choice first. It reduces company-specific risks while still riding the AI infrastructure cycle. Ultimately this stock is a typical dilemma stock: ‘it’s regrettable to miss but stressful to invest big at once,’ so choosing a position and size you can hold comfortably for the long term is most important.",
