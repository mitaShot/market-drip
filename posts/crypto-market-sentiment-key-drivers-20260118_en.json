First, if productivity improvements, stable oil prices, and tax reductions align, consumer burdens could ease — potentially supporting risk assets like crypto. Second, U.S. states such as Texas actively considering crypto for public finance use could add powerful momentum. However, if such initiatives face regulatory roadblocks or political resistance, sentiment could turn quickly."
