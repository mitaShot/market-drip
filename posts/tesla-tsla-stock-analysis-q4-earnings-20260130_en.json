        "content": "Tesla (TSLA) reported Q4 2025 earnings on January 28, posting profits that beat Wall Street estimates, sending shares up 2% in after-hours trading. However, annual revenue fell 3% for the first time in history, and full-year 2025 deliveries remained at 418,000 units (Q4 basis), a year-over-year decline of approximately 15%. The market is looking past simple EV sales deceleration, focusing instead on 'qualitative growth' driven by cost reductions and the pivot to AI/Robotaxi."

This is interpreted as a 'breather' phase to accumulate momentum following the rebound from 2024 lows. While the 100-day and 200-day long-term moving averages remain in an uptrend, providing solid technical support, breaking through the resistance in the $395–$400 range is key for the short-term trend."

Bulls like Baird and ARK Invest cite the potential of AI and autonomous driving technology to justify high price targets of $548 to $4,600 (long-term models).
